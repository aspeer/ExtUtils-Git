	* CVS.pm, support/dist_ci.inc: No longer 'touch' files that have
	mtime out of sync with CVS status, allow 'cvs status' to do this
	for us. Modify the may we go through the CVS 'Entries' file, read
	it all in at once and iterate. Previously going through it line by
	line, but were doing 'cvs' operations that changed it while we were
	iterating - result was missed some files, did some needlessly
	
	Update dist_ci to do 'cvs status' before check-in to update file
	timestamps if needed.

	* CVS.pm: Finished ci_mtime_sync method, allows mtime of file to be
	synced back to the CVS mtime, thus making mtime checks module files
	more robost, as an update -C does not fool it into thinking a file
	has changed, just because its mtime has.
	
	No change to Makefile.PL
