	Changed:
		CVS.pm (1.12), "Exp", lines: +22 -12
		support/dist_ci.inc (1.10), "Exp", lines: +2 -0

	No longer 'touch' files that have mtime out of sync with CVS
	status, allow 'cvs status' to do this for us. Modify the may we go
	through the CVS 'Entries' file, read it all in at once and iterate.
	Previously going through it line by line, but were doing 'cvs'
	operations that changed it while we were iterating - result was
	missed some files, did some needlessly

		Update dist_ci to do 'cvs status' before check-in to update
	file timestamps if needed.

2002-12-12 04:20  aspeer

	Changed:
		CVS.pm (1.10), "Exp", lines: +7 -4

	Fix long standing bug in CVS.pm that did not test for file commit
	time, rather the version file commit time, and thus missed
	commiting sometimes

		CVS.pm (1.9), "Exp", lines: +7 -9
		support/dist_ci.inc (1.9), "Exp", lines: +6 -6

	Changed:
		support/dist_ci.inc (1.8), "Exp", lines: +2 -2

	Minfor change on branch target in Makefile, make brache tags end in
	"xxx-0", rather thant "xxx-2". No real reason, other than -2 did
	not seem meaningful, as there is no 0,1

2002-10-09 01:44  aspeer

	Changed:
		CVS.pm (1.8), "Exp", lines: +2 -2

2002-06-03 23:06  aspeer

	Changed:
		CVS.pm (1.5), "Exp", lines: +10 -2

	Minor change to CVS.pm to not sync mtime of dirs

2002-06-03 22:14  aspeer

	Changed:
		CVS.pm (1.4), "Exp", lines: +98 -44

	Finished ci_mtime_sync method, allows mtime of file to be synced
	back to the CVS mtime, thus making mtime checks module files more
	robost, as an update -C does not fool it into thinking a file has
	changed, just because its mtime has.

		No change to Makefile.PL

2002-06-03 20:54  aspeer

	Changed:
		CVS.pm (1.3), "Exp", lines: +65 -4

2002-06-03 01:57  aspeer

	Changed:

	Made sure when Makefile.PL run again, it is run with ExtUtils::CVS
	modules loaded in place, so resulting Makefile still has all local
	cvs targets
