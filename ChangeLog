	  it again

2003-06-15 16:14  aspeer

	* CVS.pm (1.12), support/dist_ci.inc (1.10): No longer 'touch'
	  files that have mtime out of sync with CVS status, allow 'cvs
	  status' to do this for us. Modify the may we go through the CVS
	  'Entries' file, read it all in at once and iterate. Previously
	  going through it line by line, but were doing 'cvs' operations
	  that changed it while we were iterating - result was missed some
	  files, did some needlessly

	  Update dist_ci to do 'cvs status' before check-in to update file
	  timestamps if needed.

2002-12-12 04:20  aspeer

	  No real reason, other than -2 did not seem meaningful, as there
	  is no 0,1

2002-06-03 22:14  aspeer

	* CVS.pm (1.4): Finished ci_mtime_sync method, allows mtime of file
	  to be synced back to the CVS mtime, thus making mtime checks
	  module files more robost, as an update -C does not fool it into
	  thinking a file has changed, just because its mtime has.

	  No change to Makefile.PL

2002-06-03 20:54  aspeer

	* CVS.pm (1.3): Interim checkin only, test impleimentation of
