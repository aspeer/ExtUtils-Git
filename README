ExtUtils::Git is a class that extends ExtUtils::MakeMaker to add git related
targets to the Makefile generated from Makefile.PL.

ExtUtils::Git will enforce various rules during module distribution build,
such as not building a dist for a module before all components are checked
in to Git.  It will also not build a dist if the MANIFEST and Git ideas of
what are in the module are out of sync.

ExtUtils::Git will take care of incrementing the version number of modules
before a dist is built and other such mundane details.
